                I'm sure there is a saying in marketing that, "Packaging is key." It's not different with martial arts. Any young boy or girl will tell you that it was not the philosophy or the 'flashy' white gis that lured them in.
                No, it was the artists. The men and women who flashed kicks, knocked skulls and generally tore to shreds their opponents. These superstars need no introduction. But a little photo and video gallery doesn't hurt.

            <p>
                The martial artists above, though some have competed in tournaments and had martial training can be said by some people that they are not warriors. There is a point to this. So below are some of my favorite martial artists/warriors.
